    ![methodology](static/img/methodology.jpg)
  

  *This thesis proposes a 6-step methodology to digitalize complex manufacturing processes such as battery cell production from data creation to data storage and 
   tackle limitations to successful implementation of data analytics solutions such as lack of data acquisition, poor data quality and scarcity of usable data.*

- **Demand Management for Power-Critical Off-Grid Industrial Applications**  
  **Emmanuel Anios Fils Mompremier**, Sahan Tampoe, Nuril Hidayati, Jos√© Carlos Martinez Rosales, Jana Dundure

     ![dmsystems](static/img/dmsystems.jpg)

    *This project involves the design of DMSystems, a fast-response demand-management system capable of coping with unexpected reductions in power generation availability and guarding against unforeseen power outages. DMSystems can deliver on the technical requirement of responding to an electrical fault observed through a reduction in grid frequency below the desired threshold with a roundtrip response time of 10 milliseconds.*

**2022**

- **Operational Planning: Strategy for Charging a Pool of Electric Vehicles**  
  **Emmanuel Anios Fils Mompremier**, Pierfrancesco Losi, Olamilean Olugbayila, Yuanlu Li
  
  *The challenge is to devise a strategy for charging a pool of electric vehicles in an industrial-like microgrid by minimizing a trade-off between the costs of the electricity purchased to operate the charging station and the penalty incurred to the EV owners if their desired state of charge at departure time is not met. The electricity used in the microgrid can come from the main grid or from PV panels or from both. Additionally, there is a limit on the power that can be imported from or exported to the grid. To design the charging station's controller, the problem is modelled as as a MILP optimization with constraints*
