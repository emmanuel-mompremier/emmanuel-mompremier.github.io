## Bio

<br> I recently completed the second year of my dual master's in Decentralized Smart Energy Systems at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH</a> (joint degree with <a href="https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/en/univ-lorraine/">Universite de Lorraine</a>). My main interests and focus lie at the nexus Energy Systems/Engineering - AI - Market/Business. Prior to moving to Europe, I received my BSc in Mechanical Engineering (July 2021) at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/">National Taiwan University</a> where I joined projects related to the design, manufacture and control of autonomous robot cars & machine learning applied to renewable energy systems among others.<br>

Computer Science is a huge part of what I am. Whether it's programming robot cars, optimizing management of EV charging pool stations or learning different ML/DL models. Therefore, I took advantage of my summer internships at world-known organizations such as <a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/en.html">BMW Group</a> (Germany), <a href="https://www.loria.fr/en/"> Loria </a> (France) and <a href="https://www.itri.org.tw/english/index.aspx"> Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)</a> (Taiwan) to gain practical experience on diverse topics related to software development, digitalization, modelling of electric vehicles, technical writing and presenting, and user market research. I cherish those opportunities as they enabled me to build a network of industry leaders, researchers and peers who inspire me to keep excelling and innovating.

Having lived and studied in 5 different countries (Germany, Sweden, France, Taiwan, Haiti) over 3 continents, I have developed excellent adaptability, language, and communication skills that add value to the teams I work with. <br>
