<br>I am an incoming IT Graduate at <a href="https://www.rwe.com/en/?">RWE</a> focusing on Data Science. 
    I enjoy combining engineering first principles with emerging digital technologies to tackle challenging problems.
    My career interests lie at the intersection of digitalization of Renewable Energy Systems, AI and business innovations. <br>

<br>Previously, I interned in the IoT departments at <a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/en.html">BMW Group</a> (Munich DE in 2023) implementing end-to-end data integration strategy for EV battery cell production, 
    <a href="https://www.loria.fr/en/">LORIA</a> (Nancy FR in 2022) co-simulating the subsystems of vehicles powered by fuel cells & supercapacitors 
    and <a href="https://www.itri.org.tw/english/">Industrial Technology Research Institute ITRI</a> (Taipei TW in 2019) conducting user market research. <br>

<br>I graduated with a double master's in Decentralized Smart Energy Systems from <a href="https://www.kth.se/en"> KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> & <a href="https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/en/univ-lorraine/"> Université de Lorraine</a> (2023) as an <a href="https://densys.univ-lorraine.fr/"> Erasmus Mundus Scholar</a>. 
    I received my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/">National Taiwan University</a> (2021), with a major in mechanical engineering as a MOFA Scholar. <br>

<br>When I’m not coding or prompting, I like to compete in football leagues, travel the world with friends and read about global socio-economic & political issues.<br>
